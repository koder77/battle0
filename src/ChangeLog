Battle0 (0.2)

New: sended data is now in network byte order. See network.c/send_data() / recv_data().
The last argument is one of BYTEORDER_NET or BYTEORDER_DATA. The BYTEORDER_DATA flag
does not change the data before sending it. For example sending text string data.

Asks player for server IP if no argument given to client. Android: let player type in 
server IP. 

Move times for tank now ok.

TODO: 
- fight system
- multi player round gameplay with one active player at time. 
- more units
- Android: new on screen button theme with symbols
-
